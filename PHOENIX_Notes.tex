\subsection{PHOENIX ACES}:
Available from Goettingen  \href{http://phoenix.astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de/}{http://phoenix.astro.physik.uni-goettingen.de/}
The PHOENIX-ACES library can be hound at...
The spectra are in fits format and have headers etc. 

PHOENIX 16 code.
Quote:
Many changes have been implemented with respect to previous
PHOENIX models. For example, the more detailed treatment of
the chemical equilibrium in  the  new EOS strongly affects  the
stellar structure and results in different line and molecular band
strengths, which can introduce significant differences in comparison to older PHOENIX model spectra, especially for M stars as
discussed below. But major changes can also be expected from
the new list of element abundances and the new parameterizations
for the mixing length and the micro-turbulence. Consequentially
we observed some significant differences between spectra from
previous PHOENIX grids and from this one.
We  compared some temperature profiles with those of the
original models that have been used as a starting point for the
new library. For \(\tau> 1\) they match very well and we only see
differences for \(\tau> 1\), which are irrelevant for the morphology
of the final spectrum


Doubly affected by new atmosphere model(v16) and new physics in grid.

\section{BT Models}

 In the case of the most recent models, the Barber \& Tennison (UCL) so-called \textbf{ BT2 water vapor line list} has been used explaining why all those models bear names starting with 'BT-'. \textbf{BT-Dusty refers to dust in equilibrium with the gas phase }(sedimentation is
 neglected), while \textbf{BT-Cond includes dust condensation in equilibrium with the gas phase while neglecting their opacities in the radiative transfer}. \textbf{BT-Settl means that gravitational settling of sedimentation is accounted for in the frame of a detailed cloud model (slightly adapted from Rossow '78) which also account for supersaturation, nucleation, sedimentation and mixing.}  


\subsection{BT-Settl}

The following section is adapted straight from \url{https://phoenix.ens-lyon.fr/Grids/FORMAT}, tidied up with some extra useful notes added.

\subsubsection{FORMAT OF THE SPECTRA OUTPUT FILES}
These are the Spectra of France Allard

You can find the  pre-computed grids at \href{}{\url{add link here}}, also accessible via links on
the bottom part of the simulator presentation page, or using this link:
\href{http://phoenix.ens-lyon.fr/Grids/}{\url{http://phoenix.ens-lyon.fr/Grids/}}

The file names contain the main parameters of the models\\
lte{\(T_{eff}\)/10}-{Logg}{[M/H]}a[alpha/H].GRIDNAME.7.spec.gz/bz2/xz\\
is the synthetic spectrum for the requested effective temperature
(\(T_{eff}\)),surface gravity (Logg), metallicity by log10 number density with
respect to solar values ([M/H]), and alpha element enhancement relative     
to solar values [alpha/H]. The model grid is also mentioned in the name.

Spectra are provided in an ASCII format (*.7.gz):\\
	column1: wavelength in Angstrom\\
	column2: 10**(F\_lam + DF) to convert to Ergs/sec/\({cm}^2\)/A\\
	column3: 10**(B\_lam + DF) i.e. the blackbody fluxes of same \(T_{eff}\) in same units.\\


DF= -8.d0 for all most recent models (Ergs/sec/\({cm}^2\)/cm). For older model
series like the NextGen and AMES-Cond grids DF= -26.9007901434d0, 
because previous Phoenix outputs were giving out the luminosity, 
L (= \(R^2\) * H) in erg/s/\({cm}^2\)/cm.  And for NextGen spectra
of effective temperature 5000K and above, DF'= -28.9007901434d0.

Additional columns, obtained systematically when computing spectra using the
Phoenix simulator, give the information to identify atomic and molecular
lines. This information is used by the idl scripts lineid.pro and plotid.pro 
which are provided in the user result package.  

\textbf{Note:}
- PyAstronomy's \href{www.hs.uni-hamburg.de/DE/Ins/Per/Czesla/PyA/PyA/pyaslDoc/phoenixUtils/phoenixUtils.html}{PhoenixUtils.readUnit7} function is able to read the newer file version directly into Ergs/sec/\({cm}^2\)/cm. Multiply by 10**-8 to convert to Ergs/sec/\({cm}^2\)/A
- If handling the files manually in Python they are in IDl double format (e.g. 1.7234D+1) you need to string replace the exponential D with E to be able to convert into python floats (PyAstronomy does this already)


With the stacked ASCII format (*.spec.gz files ) we have rather:
\[
line1: T_{eff} logg [M/H] of the model
line2: number of wavelengths
line3: F_lam(n) X 10**DF , n=1,number of wavelengths
lineX: B_lam(n) X 10**DF , n=1,number of wavelengths
\]
This older file format is no longer used and no ID output is provided with those files.\\


\textbf{A very important point is that since models are often computed on parallel
computers using several nodes, it is important to sort the spectra files in
increasing wavelength order prior to using them.}

Please note that a conversion of the fluxes to absolute fluxes as measured at
the earth requires a multiplication by the dilution factor
$(radius/distance)^2$. The distance cancels out when accounting 
simultaneously for the dilution factor and distance modulus at 10 pc
(for absolute magnitudes for instance). This is done using the following
formula:
\[\rm M = m' - 5 * log10 ( R_{*} [in\ pc] ) + 5, \]

where m' is the magnitude associated to the flux F' (= 10**(lgF + DF), 
where F is the value directly contained in the spectrum file). 

\textbf{The model parameters are indicated by the name of the files.}
E.g. ``lte030-6.0-0.0.AMES-dusty.7.gz'' means a model with \(T_{eff}\)=3000K; 
logg=6.0 and [M/H]=0.0, and that it is computed using both the 
TiO and H2O line lists from Nasa \textbf{AMES}, and that it includes full 
\textbf{dust }treatment (both condensation AND opacities). In the case of the most
recent models, the Barber \& Tennison (UCL) so-called \textbf{ BT2 water vapor line list}
has been used explaining why all those models bear names starting with 'BT-'. 
\textbf{BT-Dusty refers to dust in equilibrium with the gas phase }(sedimentation is
neglected), while \textbf{BT-Cond includes dust condensation in equilibrium with the
gas phase while neglecting their opacities in the radiative transfer}. \textbf{BT-Settl
means that gravitational settling of sedimentation is accounted for in the
frame of a detailed cloud model (slightly adapted from Rossow '78) which also
account for supersaturation, nucleation, sedimentation and mixing.}   

Note that Phoenix delivers synthetic spectra in the vacuum and that a line
shift is necessary to adapt these synthetic spectra for comparisons to
observations from the ground. For this, divide the vacuum wavelengths by
(1+1.e-6*nrefrac) as returned from the function below to get the air 
wavelengths (or use the equation for AIR from it). 

\lstset{language=Pascal} 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python, frame=single]  % Start your code-block

def nrefrac(wavelength, density=1.0):
    """Calculate refractive index of air from Cauchy formula.

    Input: wavelength in Angstrom, density of air in amagat (relative to STP,
    e.g. ~10% decrease per 1000m above sea level).
    Returns N = (n-1) * 1.e6. 
    """

    # The IAU standard for conversion from air to vacuum wavelengths is given
    # in Morton (1991, ApJS, 77, 119). For vacuum wavelengths (VAC) in
    # Angstroms, convert to air wavelength (AIR) via: 

    #  AIR = VAC / (1.0 + 2.735182E-4 + 131.4182 / VAC^2 + 2.76249E8 / VAC^4)

    try:
        if isinstance(wavelength, types.ObjectType):
            wl = np.array(wavelength)
    except TypeError:
        return None

    wl2inv = (1.e4 / wl)**2
    refracstp = 272.643 + 1.2288 * wl2inv  + 3.555e-2 * wl2inv**2
    return density * refracstp
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{DISCLAIMER}

\textit{
The model atmospheres and synthetic spectra ARE ONLY addressing the PHOTOSPHERE
and do not include parts of the atmosphere which are not governed by
hydrostatic equilibrium such as chromosphere's and corona for stars or
exospheric evaporation in the case of irradiated planets or stars. }

\textit{The simulator uses the most recent code version to generate as close as
possible spectra compatible with the published grids i.e. by adopting the
same parameters (mixing length, geometry of the radiative transfer, opacities
for the most important when possible). No attempts has been made to reproduce 
those older results exactly.}
